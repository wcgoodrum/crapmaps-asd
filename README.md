Project for Advanced Software Developement (CS-3240)

Crapmaps is a web app built Django and SQL and hosted using Heroku.
Crapmaps does what you think it does: it is a map of bathrooms on campus that allows users to track their statistics and leave reviews.

I've imported this project to my personal page for recruiters and interviewers. My role in this project was Scrum Master. I was responsible for issue creation and tracking, logistics of meetings, communication with the professor and TAs, and task delegation. I don't know why, but I don't show up as a contributor anymore in github insights and all of the issues are still on the private repository.
